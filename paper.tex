% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,

% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\subsection*{Abstract}
Content delivery networks (CDN) and overlay networks count for most of today's Internet traffic and have large impact on performance of applications (e.g., video streaming and web) that rely on them. 
Traditionally, these networks are based on distributed, rather than centralized protocols, which works more resilient and responsive in large geo-distribuetd networks. However, the trend of growing traffic volume and demands for high quality experience and that of global control planes for application call for a logically centralized architecture of CDNs and overlay networks at large where servers are coordinated in a global scale. 

To address this, we presents software-defined CDN (SDCDN), a logically centralized architecture for CDNs and, in particular, Live streaming. It is similar in spirit to software-defined networks (SDN), but differs in several key aspects. As a design choice, we argue that neithor fully centralization (i.e, SDN) nor fully decentralization (i.e., current CDN) is most desirable for CDN control plane. Instead, a careful division of functionalities between distributed servers and centralized controllers is needed to achieve both performance benefits of global coordination and faster recovery from failures.
