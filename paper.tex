% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate

\subsection*{Abstract}
Content delivery networks (CDN) serve a significant fraction of today's Internet traffic and have huge impact on performance of applications (e.g., video streaming and web) that rely on them. 
State-of-the-art CDNs are based on distributed protocols, which have been proved resilient in large geo-distribuetd networks. However, as CDNs expand its scale to meet the trends of growing traffic volume and demands for higher quality experience, the operational and management complexity raises and, as a result, it becomes challenging to fully utilize the capacities of CDN infrastructure effectively.

To address this, we presents the design and implementation of \SDCDN, the first logically centralized architecture for CDNs where a controller can perform global optimization for the distributed servers based on a network-wide view of network states and demands. We demonstrate that \SDCDN can achieve much better utilization of server capacities, simplify the management, but also mitigate the fault-tolerance, inconsistency and scalability issues brought by the centralized architecture.
While it is similar in spirit to the software-defined networks (SDN), our appraoch also differs in several key aspects. We argue that the scale of wide-area deployments and flexible data plane means neithor fully centralization (i.e, SDN) nor fully decentralization (i.e., current CDN) is  desirable for an \SDCDN. Instead, a careful division of functionalities between centralized controllers and distributed nodes is required to achieve both performance benefits of global coordination and faster recovery from failures. Our evaluation shows that \fillme
