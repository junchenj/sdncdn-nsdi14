\section{Properties}

\subsection{Dissemination consistency}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Inconsistency of multiple versions of same controller: formulate the problem, introduce the solution
	\item Inconsistency of different controllers: formulate the problem, introduce the solution
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Fault tolerance}

Two stages after failure happens: local decision loop, and global decision loop


\subsection{Application-level quality improvement}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Example way to express quality and cost requirement
	\item Example algorithm to solve them
\end{itemize}
