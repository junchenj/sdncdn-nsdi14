\section{Motivation}
\subsection{Why centralization?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Like in traditional SDN argument, a centralized control platform enables the development of flexible, reliable and feature-richer network control plane.
	\item Centralization enables global coordination of resources to optimize for complex application goal. Use example.
	\item Centralization enables better recovery and convergence in disruptive/congested networks. Use example.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Why not fully centralized?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Longer propagation delay than in LAN/WAN. \jc{need measurement data to support this.}
	\item Long delay to get a converged network view under large-area disruption/congestion. \jc{need measurement data to support this.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Two level control plane design}
Present our design of control plane that runs both in local node and controller.
